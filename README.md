# Samchika

**Samchika** (meaning _File_ in Sanskrit) is a **re-usable**, **easy-to-use**, and **extremely fast** file processing library for the Java language.

It is built with a strong focus on **multithreading** to handle CPU-intensive file processing tasks in parallel, enabling high performance even with massive files.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîÅ Fully multithreaded ‚Äì optimized for parallel file processing.
- üß© Simple API ‚Äì just plug in your file path and logic.
- üìä Optional runtime stats ‚Äì time taken, memory used, thread-level info.
- üß™ Ideal for processing and analyzing **large text files** (e.g. logs, datasets).
- üåç Open-source friendly ‚Äì contributions are welcome!

---

## Use Cases
Samchika excels in several scenarios where multithreaded file processing provides significant advantages:

- Log Analysis & Processing
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Operations
- Large Text Corpus Processing
- Batch Report Generation
- Data Transformation Pipelines
- Real-time Data Processing

See the examples directory for detailed implementations of these use cases.

### Quick Example
java// Transform a large CSV file with optimal performance

```
SmartFileProcessor.builder()
    .inputPath("large_dataset.csv")
    .outputPath("transformed_dataset.csv")
    .batchSize(10000)
    .lineProcessor(line -> line.toUpperCase())
    .displayStats(true)
    .build()
    .execute();
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Step 1: Import the Library 

```
import com.samchika.SmartFileProcessor;
```

### Step 2: Client Code 

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SmartFileProcessor processor = SmartFileProcessor.builder()
        .inputPath("input.txt")         // Path to the file to be processed
        .outputPath("output.txt")       // Path to write the output
        .lineProcessor(Main::processLine) // Your business logic per line
        .displayStats(true)             // Optional: display runtime stats
        .build();

    processor.execute();
}
```

## üìà Performance
Benchmarked against na√Øve BufferedReader-based implementations on files of various sizes:

‚úÖ 200 MB

‚úÖ 1 GB

‚úÖ 5 GB

‚úÖ 16 GB

Significant performance improvements were observed, especially in multi-core systems ( More than 70% performance gain ) 

The gain in time saved improves in comparison to naive code, as we increase the size of input file.  Also for huge performance gain in time, the memory used for even large files ( 16GB ) is manageable ( ~ 800 MB ).

## üí° Inspiration

This project was inspired by:

1) Shubham Maurya ( https://github.com/complex1 ) , a dear friend,  who published a JavaScript library ‚Äì which sparked the motivation to do something similar in Java.

2) A LinkedIn post discussing the challenges of processing large text files ‚Äì which gave me the idea to solve it with an elegant API and fast multithreaded architecture.
